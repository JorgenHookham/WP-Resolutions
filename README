Adaptive-Images for WordPress: make sure that image files are never bigger than what a device can use.

== Description ==

Resolutions will make sure that image files are never bigger than what a device can use, so the 4000 X 4000 photos that your client or content team post won’t melt any smartphones.

It is a one-click WordPress implementation of Matt Wilcox's Adaptive-Images plugin. See http://adaptive-images.com for more info.

**Features**
* Up and running in seconds.
* Protects your website from misuse by content creators, clients, etc.
* Makes images on your site load faster.
* Saves bandwidth for everyone.

**How It Works**
When a device lands a Resolutions-enabled site, JavaScript creates a cookie that stores the device’s resolution. Then, .htaccess redirects image requests to adaptive-images.php, which reads the cookie and creates/caches appropriately sized versions of images before sending them to the viewer.
